                        Whisky (without an "e") is generally used for Scotch, Canadian, and Japanese whiskies.
                        Whiskey (with an "e") is typically used for Irish and American whiskeys.

                        While the spelling distinction between "whisky" and "whiskey" is primarily based on the spirit's origin,
                         there are some differences in the production and flavor profiles of whiskies and whiskeys from different regions.

                        The popular Scotch Whisky is known for its smoky flavor, often due to the use of peat in the malting process.
                         It's typically distilled twice in copper pot stills and aged for at least three years in oak casks.

                        There's a diverse category among the American Whiskeys that includes bourbon, rye, and Tennessee whiskey. 
                        These whiskeys often have a sweeter flavor profile due to the grains used and the aging process in new charred oak barrels.
