# odin-landing-page
This is my design for the 'Project: Landing Page' of The Odin Project.

During this project I became much more familiar with how to use flexbox in order to make a decent looking webpage.
I made sure to make it responsive with the flex-wrap property, even though it was not needed.

I had a lot of fun. It helped me become much more familiar with css and helped me improve my decisions concerning the design of an html file.
There's much more for me to learn, yet I believe this is a step in the right direction for me.


About the landing page itsef, I like drinking whisky, so as a way to have fun, I made it about whisky.
The photos of bottles and glasses were taken from Pexels. Inside the index.html file the links can be found.
I also cited a quote from W.C. Fields, the website from which the quote was taken is inside the index, too.

Thank you very much if you took the time to read this.
Also, thanks to the Odin Project! 
It's a wonderful thing what they've created.
